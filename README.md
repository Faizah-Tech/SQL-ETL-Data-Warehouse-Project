📌 Repository Name: SQL-ETL-Data-Warehouse-Project
📝 Project Description
This project is a full-fledged ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline that integrates and processes data from multiple sources into a SQL-based Data Warehouse. It leverages SQL, SSIS, and Power BI for data transformation, reporting, and visualization.


The primary goal is to clean, transform, and analyze data for better business insights, making it ideal for financial services, sales, or business intelligence applications.

🔧 Tech Stack Used
SQL Server – For database management and structured query processing
SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) – For ETL automation
Power BI – For data visualization and reporting
Control-M (Optional) – For job scheduling and automation

🏗 ETL Process Overview
Extract – Data is pulled from various sources like CSV files, APIs, or databases.
Transform – Data is cleaned, normalized, and aggregated using SQL queries.
Load – Transformed data is loaded into a SQL Data Warehouse for reporting.
Analyze – Power BI dashboards provide insights from structured data.


🚀 Features & Functionalities
✅ Data cleaning, normalization, and transformation using SQL & SSIS
✅ Optimized query performance using indexing and partitioning
✅ Data Warehouse Schema design for efficient reporting
✅ Automated ETL execution via Control-M or SQL Agent
✅ Interactive Power BI visualizations for business insights
